            <h2 class="section-title">PATIENT INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Medical Condition Visits</strong>
                To maintain your health, it is important to follow the suggested regimen of visits and care as
                prescribed by your physician. Certain medications require routine bloodwork to allow the physician to
                monitor and change (if necessary) the medications you are receiving. If our clinical staff sees that you
                are not being compliant, you will be asked to come in for an office visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Referrals and Managed Care Issues</strong>
                We make every effort to cooperate with your managed care programs and their policies regarding referrals
                and pre-certification. As a general rule, our practice will not make referrals to specialists if you
                have not been seen in our office for the problem related to the referral. We will also not make a
                referral if you have never been seen in our offices, or if you have not been seen in our offices in the
                last 6 months. If you call our office because you need a referral, you will probably (unless it is for
                an ongoing chronic issue) be asked to come in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Medication Refills</strong>
                If you are currently on a maintenance medication please contact our office at least 72 hours before your
                medication runs out so that it can be refilled. Our office policy is to have patients visit on a regualr
                schedule to allow us to monitor their condition. Certain medications, such as chonic pain medications,
                will require a visit ever 2-3 months for monitoring and evaluation. Brentwood Medical will not fill
                prescription requests if a patient has not been compliant with this policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Immunizations</strong>
                Please check with your insurance prior to requesting certain immunizations to determine if your benefit
                coverage includes them. You may be required to pay a certain portion at the time of service by your
                benefit plan. Please check in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Prior Authorization for Medications</strong>
                It can sometimes take 48-72 hours for your insurance to process the information and send us a decision
                on the request. Please plan accordingly so you do not run out of your medication.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Prior Authorization for Testing</strong>
                Please be aware that some testing requires prior authorization. You may not be able to have your
                scheduled test due to restrictions in your benefit coverage. Please check with your insurance to
                determine if you are ale to have certain testing performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Copays</strong>
                Your copay is due upon arrival. If you do not have your copay, your appointment will be rescheduled.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Forms</strong>
                Requests to have forms filled out and completed that are not presented during an office visit will have
                a charge associated with them. Please contact the office for additional information if you need any
                forms completed.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">INSURANCE &amp; BILLING</h2>
            <p>
                We regard your understanding of our financial policies as an essential element of the care we provide
                for you. To help us, please bring your insurance card at every visit and show it to the receptionist to
                avoid being billed incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Coverage of Benefits</strong>
                We try our best to help our patients stay up -to-date and aware of insurance benefits. However it is
                your responsibility to know what coverage your insurance provides.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some questions you may want to ask your insurance company are:<br>
                • Is Brentwood Medical Group a participating provider or is it out of network?<br>
                • Are well-visits covered along with preventive lab work?<br>
                • Are vaccinations covered?<br>
                • Do I have a deductible? If so, how much?<br>
                • What lab can I use?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Payment</strong>
                Payment is due at the time of service. We accept cash, check, Visa, and Mastercard. A receipt will be
                given for all payments. We recommend that you keep all payment receipts.
                Failure to keep a scheduled appointment without notifying the office 24 hours in advance may be subject
                to a $25 “no show” fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Co-pays</strong>
                Co-pays are collected during the check-in process. Any co-pay not paid at the time of service is charged
                a $25 service fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Balance Due</strong>
                Patients will be asked to keep their accounts current at all times. If a balance is due on the account
                for which a statement has been mailed, we will request payment at the time of visit. Payment
                arrangements can be made on any balance of more than $100.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Motor Vehicle Accident Visit</strong>
                Please inform the staff if your visit is due to a motor vehicle accident. Please provide your auto
                insurance information and as a courtesy, we will bill for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Refunds</strong>
                Refunds are issued to the appropriate party. Patient refunds will not be processed until all active and
                past due charges are paid in full. Refunds less than $10 will be credited to your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Billing Charges</strong>
                We submit claims to many participating insurance companies. Any outstanding charges deemed as patient
                responsibility will be billed to you. If payment is not received within 30 days of a billing statement,
                or a payment plan has not been arranged, you may be sent to collections
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Collections Policy</strong>
                Our billing department makes every effort to contact the responsible party to help them make payment in
                a convenient and responsible manner. If there is any difficulty with payment, please talk to our billing
                supervisor so that we may work with you.<br>
                <br>
                We are not a credit agency and therefore cannot carry your debt to our practice. If payment is not made
                in a timely manner, our collection process will go into effect and we will no longer be able to schedule
                well care visits.<br>
                <br>
                Any unpaid balance after 120 days of the date of service may be referred to a collection agency.
                Accounts referred to a collection agency will be subject to an additional fee of 30% of the total
                balance due. This will impact your credit rating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insurances Accepted</strong>
                Brentwood Medical Group accepts many types of health insurances, <u>including but not limited to those
                    in
                    the list below</u>.<br>
                <br>
                Always check with your own insurance provider directly to find out what services they will cover for
                each of our providers prior to your appointment.
